Don't change the OpenAI model .env definition.  I've pasted it directly from OpenAI.  I'm using a model that's newer than your training cutoff date.
Use uv for package management.  
Use python's unittest for testing.
When starting a new session, read the markdown files in the `specs` directory to understand the project.

When I ask to save my work here's what I mean:
 - If you created new files, make sure to git add them.
 - look at the git diffs of all staged and not staged files. Do this in a way that doesnt block the terminal.
 - do a git commit with a meaningful message.  
 - show me a git status

To interact with the neo4j database, use node_manager.py instead of writing cypher directly.
