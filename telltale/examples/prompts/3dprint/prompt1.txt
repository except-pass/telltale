When the nozzle is too close to the print bed:
- The first layer appears transparent or extremely thin
- The extruded plastic spreads out too wide, beyond the expected line width
- You may hear a scratching sound as the nozzle moves
- The nozzle can become partially blocked due to back pressure
- Subsequent layers may have poor adhesion or gaps
- In extreme cases, no plastic will come out at all

To check if the nozzle is blocked:
- Try to extrude filament in mid-air (use the LCD menu's extrude function)
- Look for curved or inconsistent extrusion instead of straight lines
- Check if the extruded filament diameter matches your nozzle size
- Listen for clicking sounds from the extruder, indicating skipping

When the nozzle is too far from the print bed:
- The first layer appears rounded or rope-like instead of flat
- Poor adhesion to the print bed, filament may not stick at all
- Visible gaps between print lines
- The printed lines appear thinner than expected
- The print may warp or detach during printing
- Subsequent layers will have poor layer bonding

Quick fixes:
1. Use Live Z adjustment during the first layer calibration
2. Clean the print bed surface thoroughly
3. Check if the print bed is properly leveled
4. Verify the bed temperature is appropriate for your filament
5. If persistent, recalibrate the First Layer Calibration in the printer's menu
